# SwiftUI Calculator App

Welcome to my SwiftUI calculator app project! This project showcases a sleek and minimalist calculator user interface built using SwiftUI.

## About the Project

This project is my very first SwiftUI project, aimed at learning the basics of SwiftUI and exploring its capabilities in building user interfaces for iOS apps. The calculator app UI includes standard arithmetic operations and provides a clean and intuitive user experience.
